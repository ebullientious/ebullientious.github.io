<div class="content"> <p>Camilla and Selina have been friends since third grade. When they were kids they would watch soccer games on TV and talk about it over the phone, one day fulfilling their childhood dream of watching it live in Beijing 2008. Camilla now is pursuing her PhD in badassery -- ahem -- really complicated biology stuff that involves studying the craniofacial diseases affecting humans by replicating potential solutions in fish and frogs. At least that's what Selina thinks it sounded like.</p> <p>Laura met Selina in high school. One day in high school Selina remarked that Laura had a badass umbrella, the kind that collapsed with the push of a button. To Selina's surprise, Laura got Selina the same umbrella a few days later. This made a huge impact on Selina; she had never met a more generous person.</p> <p>Lauren and Selina were college sweethearts. Ok, not really, but they met because of a debt Lauren (aka LT the OG) owed. Selina was having difficulties in her algorithms class and LT was tasked with paying the knowledge forward. LT introduced Selina to the joys of raw fish, ramen, and endless patience. </p> </div>
