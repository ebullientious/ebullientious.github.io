<p>My first blog entry! I am using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as my blogging platform, as it seemed
nerd-tastic for the Engineer in me. I’m 27 after all. Away with Facebook’s predecessor, <a href="http://unusualtaste.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>; begone attention-seeking <a href="http://stinkycheeseman.xanga.com/">Xanga</a>; farewell <a href="http://selinachang.blogspot.com/">Blogspot</a> (does anyone use that anymore?). </p>

<p>I am inspired to create a blog because of the experiences and interactions I’ve had recently. 
My short term goal is to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, since it seems to be the tech equivalent of the collegiate academic’s <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>.
My longer term goal is to absorb information that I’ve learned, as I feel impassioned by others’ brilliant ideas. But, like any garden,
without consciously nurturing them, they can wither and be forgotten. And I hope this knowledge garden can bloom.</p>

<p>Last week I went to a conference called “<a href="https://www.inventyourfuture.com/events/conferences/2014-silicon-valley/">Invent Your Future</a>”. Its mission is to
help women develop their careers through workshops/seminars. </p>

<p>The engaging keynote speaker, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Levine">Alison Levine</a> made an impression on me – she’s climbed Mount Everest twice,
leading the first women’s expedition up the perilous trek; she teaches leading in extreme conditions at West Point; and 
despite her 5’4” frame, she looks like she can tear me apart.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/everest-expedition-map.jpg" alt="Mount Everest Camps" /></p>

<p>Unlike what anybody would imagine, hikers who dare climb Mount Everest do not 
just climb straight up. After spending a few days at the base camp to get their bodies acclimated to the altitude, they hike
to the first camp and spend a night there. Surprisingly, they come back down to base camp, to start over again.</p>

<p>In the picture, you can see that there’s four different camps. At every camp they hit,
they return to base to start over, advancing by one more camp on each trip up. No wonder it takes two months to get to the top. </p>

<p>The first time she went, Alison’s group didn’t make it. Hundreds of yards away from the summit, she discovered
her oxygen tank was empty. At the altitude she was aiming for, human life is unsustainable. Her body was running on fumes. 
Knowing each step cost 5-10 slow and heavy breaths, she made the tough decision to turn her team back.</p>

<p>Several years later, she made the trip again. Motivated by the death of a friend who’d tease her about going up to Mount Everest to finish her business, she got another team together. They made it to the top this time. </p>

<p>What did I learn?</p>

<p>That it’s ok to go on a path backwards, because it can prepare you for something greater in the future. This is the
same message that Sheryl Sandberg explains in a chapter of <em><a href="http://leanin.org/book/">Lean In</a></em> titled “It’s a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder”. </p>

<p>Sometimes we invest time – years working for a goal. And a lot of us are afraid of trying to do something different,
of starting from square one in a different field. We feel that we wasted all that experience, that we must remain
in it because we’ve sacrificed a lot to get where we are. Because of the doubt, we miss out on opportunities to 
do something we love. Sheryl cites a story of a woman working four years at a law firm, with the goal of making partner. She was
unhappy with her line of work, and was interested in entering marketing/sales field. But this meant from dropping out of the track
of being partner to becoming a newbie in another industry. Despite Sheryl’s pleas to consider the change, she opted out. Sheryl had
multiple success stories of people having to start from the bottom when they made career changes, and excelled at their new roles because 
they were the kind of people who had a passion for problem solving and the guts to take risks, knowing that the outcome
could be greater than the path they were on.</p>

<p>I’m open to constructive feedback on how my writing, how I can improve my observational behavior, or just general story swapping.</p>
